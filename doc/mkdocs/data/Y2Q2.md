# Y2Q2

This application has been developed during the first semester of 2019, with the aim of enlarging the scenarios to include clinical tests (besides rehabilitation exercises as in [Y1Q3](Y1Q3.md)). Such scenarios highlight the advantage of using a robot, given by the autonomous execution of the test (which is highly repetitive for physiotherapists) and the storage of quantitative results.

We started with the Timed Up and Go (TUG), which measures the time the patient takes to get up from a chair, walk for 3 meters, turn around, go back to the chair and seat again. While it's easy for a physiotherapist to measure the execution time, it's much more complicated to evaluate limbs metrics during the test (such as range of motion, step length), unless of equipping the patient and the room with sensors.

In such scenario, the robot has to:

- explain the test to the patient;
- **naturally interact** with the patient and reply to his / her questions;
- **navigate** in the environment;
- monitor the patient while doing the test;
- extract real-time **metrics of the lower limbs** and export them in a final report for further analysis.
