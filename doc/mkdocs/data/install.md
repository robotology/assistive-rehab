## Installation

If all the dependencies are met, proceed with the following instructions:

!!! example "From sources"

    Substitute to `<install-prefix>` the absolute path where you want to install the project.

    ````tab="GNU/Linux and macOS"
    git clone https://github.com/robotology/assistive-rehab.git
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install-prefix>
    make
    make install
    ````

    ````tab="Windows"
    git clone https://github.com/robotology/assistive-rehab.git
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install-prefix>
    make
    make install
    ````
